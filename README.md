## Task description

You are given a design template of a possible redesign of a part of our home page. Your task is to convert this into a simple static web page using HTML & CSS. The web design consists of the following components: Logo, main navigation, meta navigation (language switch, search ...), hero teaser with copy text and a linked product video.
Using the Figma link
https://www.figma.com/file/gq31DEBaeOXLvfxrCI6bqK/think-cell-recruiting-challenge?type=design&node-id=6%3A77&mode=dev
you can check out the design specifications for the designed desktop viewport and download all required image assets in the previous e-mail. If you cannot use Figma, please use the attached PDF document and assets as an alternative.
Your solution should resemble the design template, but you don’t have to strictly follow all details. Feel free to take some “creative freedom” or bring in your own ideas or improvements for the page.

## Technical Requirements

- The template must work in modern browsers.
- There should be a responsive implementation for at least three viewport sizes.
- If required assets or specifications are missing, you can implement alternatives.
- A sub-navigation is not required.
- You can use your preferred code editor and frameworks/libraries. If build tools are used, please provide a short readme for the build process and the HTML file with all resources.
